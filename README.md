# StatsBombData-RStudio-Guide
Purpose of Project: Exploring how to extract, clean, visualize, and analyze football data to gain valuable insights into player performance, team tactics, and more. 

Through this guide provided by StatBombData, I have learnt about:
1. Creating custom dataframes to explore what I want to find about regarding the players, team, etc.
2. Plotting and creating visualisations to display my findings.
3. The systematic approach of how a typical football analyst workflow would go.
